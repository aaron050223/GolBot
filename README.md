- If the league is not valid, the bot will report that the selected league does not exist.
- If the bot cannot get the data from the Football-Data.org API, it will show you an error message.

## **4. Explanation of the code**

### 4.1.¬†**Modules used**

- `requests`: Used to make HTTP requests to the Football-Data.org API.
- `telebot`: Library to interact with the Telegram API and create the bot.
- datetime` and `pytz`: To handle dates and times, setting the time zone to Madrid (Europe/Madrid).

### 4.2.¬†**Funciones principales**

- **`start()`**: Sends a welcome message with the bot options when it starts.
- **`obtener_partidos()`**: Gets the matches of the specified league (today or matchday).
- **`obtener_clasificacion()`**: Gets the rankings of the selected league.
- **`obtener_maximos()`**: Shows the top scorers of the selected league.
- **`formatear_partido()`**: Formats the information of each match to present it clearly.


### 4.3.¬†**Usage considerations**

This bot uses the Football-Data.org API, which has a request limit. Make sure not to make too many requests in a short period of time to avoid crashes. Also, the API may be temporarily unavailable, in which case the bot will not be able to get the data.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **¬°Important!** The bot only works **running the python file**, if you don't run the bot **doesn't** work.
