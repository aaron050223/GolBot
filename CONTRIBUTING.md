# How to Clone the Repository and Contribute

This guide explains step-by-step how to clone this repository locally and contribute changes to the project.

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

To get a local copy of the repository, follow these steps:

1. **Make sure Git is installed**
   If you don’t have Git installed, download and install it from:
   [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. **Clone the repository**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaron050223/GolBot.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` and `your-repository` with the actual values.

3. **Enter the project folder**

   ```bash
   cd GolBot
   ```

## 2. Create a Branch for Your Changes

It’s good practice to work on a separate branch for each new feature or fix. This keeps the code organized and avoids conflicts.

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Replace `your-branch-name` with a descriptive name, for example, `fix-typo` or `add-login-feature`.

---

## 3. Make Your Changes

Edit the code or add files as needed.

---

## 4. Stage and Commit Your Changes

After making your changes, stage the modified files:

```bash
git add .
```

This adds all changed files. To add specific files, replace `.` with the file names.

Then create a commit with a clear message describing your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Clear description of the changes you made"
```

---

## 5. Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

This uploads your changes to your branch on GitHub.

---

## 6. Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub.
2. You’ll see a prompt to open a Pull Request for the branch you just pushed.
3. Create the Pull Request, add a clear description, and wait for someone to review your changes.

---

## 7. Review and Merge

Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch.
